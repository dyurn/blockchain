# Blockchain Analyzer

## Overview

This Python project provides tools to fetch and analyze data from Bitcoin blockchain blocks. It allows users to navigate through blocks, visualize key statistics, and detect potential anomalies in block times and mining fees as selfish mining attacks.

## Features

- Fetch block data using the Blockchain.com API.
- Navigate through blockchain blocks forward and backward.
- Select blocks for deeper analysis.
- Visualize various block attributes such as mining fees, number of transactions, and block sizes.
- Perform automatic or manual analysis of block sequences to detect trends or anomalies.

## Installation

- `requests` for making API calls.
- `matplotlib` and `numpy` for data visualization.
